[**MEAN Stack: Build an App with Angular 2+ and the Angular CLI**](https://www.sitepoint.com/mean-stack-angular-2-angular-cli/)  
This tutorial intends to create the MEAN application from scratch and serve as an update to the original MEAN stack tutorial.  
**Description**: We’ll be building an Awesome Bucket List Application from the ground up without using any boilerplate template. The front end will include a form that accepts your bucket list items and a view that updates and renders the whole bucket list in real time. Any update to the view will be interpreted as an event and this will initiate an HTTP request. The server will process the request, update/fetch the MongoDB if necessary, and then return a JSON object. The front end will use this to update our view.
